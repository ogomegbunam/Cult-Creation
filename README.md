# Cult-Creation
Creating a cult starts with the way in which you build your team — the hiring process. If you build your team in a certain way, the
culture inherent in that team will give birth to the cult itself. It won’t be you, as the founder, who will own or control the credo of
the cult, it will be the team itself. Your job is to control the principles, practices and processes by which the team is built.
The following principles are  they guildelines in creating a Cult:

1)DO NOT NEGOTIATE — IT’S NOT FAIR, OR SMART-Many founders are almost by nature programmed to negotiate everything. In
some cases, I have seen founders take advantage of people who don’t negotiate well, see it as culturally not ok, or who simply hate to 
negotiate so much that it’s a near-phobic experience.
One of the things that is incredibly important for a founder in today’s engineering world is to create a logical and rational hiring plan
with salaries and equities mapped out in a spread sheet. These could help in someways-
a) Engineers generally hate negotiating anyway and if there was one word I would use to describe their general reaction, it would be
“relief” on the candidates part.
b) Engineers are highly logical people and if you email them your spreadsheet and explain that you negotiate with no one and that their
peers in the company determine their skill sets and thus their strata, not HR, then all that’s really left is for them to check your logic
in your spreadsheet. If it is sound, then I have found it removes perhaps the most awkward and stressful part of the hiring process and 
turns it into a logical and rational process — which engineers like.
c) Further, you will like it as well, it will help prevent you from doing stupid things that you regret and get bitten in the ass for 
later anyway.
d) It will also enable you to have a very different conversation when the candidate gets to you. Instead of this part of the process being 
confrontational, where you are the opposition, there is no opposition. You and the candidate can simply talk about what’s really 
important. Them interviewing you.
2)WHY BUY SILVER WHEN YOU CAN RENT GOLD?-The success or failure of most startups is determined within their first two years, so having
gold(experienced or well known best of programmers) so that you can ride on thier network and legacy even for a short time could make a
difference.
3)SHOOT FOR THE MOON- This is knowing what you need and going for the best.
4)MAKE SOUP, NOT STEAK- One of the problems many start ups ecounter is knowing what they actually need in thier teams,If startups were a
soup, being talented is just the stock, the palette, the canvas for the soup. It’s each persons x-factor, their personality and their 
quirks are the spices that make the soup work. A great soup is one where the chef is constantly adjusting, tasting and envisioning what
to add next.
5) EARN YOUR JOB-the beginning of every interview should begin with the founder earning their job first,start by letting the candidate
know that you like to start with them interviewing you.See the interview through the eyes of the person you are hiring. Earn your job as
a founder in every interview first and you’ll win their heart.
6)TREAT EVERYONE LIKE GOLD- No matter how good or bad a candidate is they are humans too treat them with respect.
7)FIND YOUR SECRET SWAMI-Some people code, some design, some understand brand and some sell things. Every person you bring into your 
company has some x-factor skill that you want to take advantage of when you are hiring.
8)CREATE THE BEST, WORST-CASE SCENARIO-One of the questions a candidate is going to ask  is going to be “what’s the worst-case 
scenario?” what the worst-case would look like, and to describe the financial implications, reputation implications and technology usage 
implications as it related to them. 
9)HIRE SLOW-ER-ER, THEN FIRE SLOWER-ER-ER-ER.
10)THERE’S YES AND THERE’S EVERYTHING ELSE-By giving your team simple rules for what “yes” is and that “no” is simply everything else, 
your team will find it easier to let go of the guilt normally associated with saying no to a candidate- — ultimately saving you from
hiring the wrong person.
11)THE MAGIC OF THE ONE MILE RULE-$5,000 per year is about the difference in a one bedroom apartment in the East Bay versus right in
SOMA (where startups live). If you calculate the average additional time spent, the reduction and stress and other benefits — it far
outweighs the $5,000 outlay.
Here’s why it works.
a)No longer had a commute, so each person captured hours back for their life
b)They were happier because they had less road rage and less drama in their lives
c)The spouses, girlfriends, boyfriends and pets were much happier
d)They stayed longer at the ofﬁce because they knew they could always just run home
e)They were much more productive
f)Once some people did it, other copied and
g)We got way more value than the $5,000 per year we paid.
12)IF THEN STATEMENTS WORK-For many founders, hiring the initial team is one big chicken and egg problem. Investors want to see a group
of super talented people committed to your idea before you have any money.I’m a big believer that the best ideas are those where you can convince people to join even when there is no money. Following the talent is an easy way to see where the best startups are forming.
So how do you do this?
a)Write down the names of your founding employee targets — the initial people you are trying to convince to join.
b)Write down any dependencies that exist between those people. i.e. if that guy joins then I’ll join.
c)Write down the dependencies for each person that are independent of the other candidates.
d)Highlight dependencies from #c that are common among the candidates.
e)Write down those dependencies from #d that are necessary to solve before your next conversation with each candidate
d)Write down those dependencies from #d that you need to solve before they would be willing to sign an offer letter
f)Write down those dependencies from #d that you need to solve before each candidate is willing to quit their current job and join -
notice I differentiated between signing an offer letter and quitting their existing job and working full time.
13)DEMO FRIDAY-Always make Demo Day a private affair between you and your employees. Never make Demo Day about bright and shiny things 
over substance. Never make it about recruiting, or showing off, or a place where introverts, people with difficulty speaking public, or
simply people who’s work can’t be demo’d feel disenfranchised. Keep Demo Day sacred, personal, and about progress towards north.
14)NEVER LET GO-Once you identify a super A that you want to join the team, it’s critical that you never let go. Because if you get
them, it creates an unlock for the rest of your company.
15)ONE FORMULA TO RULE THEM ALL-Super A = Uber-connected leaders are super A’s. Get one of those and 10 A-level people will join. a=a. 
A-level people that aren’t super-connected will at least recruit one other A-level person.
Super B=Super-connected B-level people, “super Bs,” are the most dangerous of all for 2 reasons. People who are B-level know it and
therefore often refer C-level people to join so that they end up looking good when compared relative to their co-workers (i.e. b=c). 
Therefore Super-Bs will invite 10 C-levels to join, which is a total disaster.
C=0 In an effort to improve the gene pool, C-level people should simply be killed, (metaphorically speaking, of course) or at least kept
as far away as possible from your company.
16)CREATE A DOMINANT MARKET SHARE
17)TRY BEFORE YOU BUY-The best way, the fairest way, to interview anyone is to work with them.
18)WAR CRY-I love to think of entrepreneurs as heroes of a sort. To imagine a single person that starts with a simple idea and then turns that idea into a permanent monument of human accomplishment
